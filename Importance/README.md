To Anyalysis the Improtance of Features, three steps are involved:

Step1: 
Run `colliner.R` to detect correlated features; 
Remove correlated features manually (please refer to the paper about how to filter correlated features), and write the removed features in `collinearity-analysed.csv`.

Step2: 
Run `redun.R` to detect redundent features.

Step3: 
Run `importance.R` to get the importance level of each feature.
